HACL*
=====

HACL* is a formally verified cryptographic library in [F\*],
developed by the [Prosecco](http://prosecco.inria.fr) team at 
[INRIA Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris) in collaboration
with Microsoft Research, as part of [Project Everest].

HACL stands for High-Assurance Cryptographic Library and its design is
inspired by discussions at the [HACS series of workshops](https://github.com/HACS-workshop).
The goal of this library is to develop verified C reference implementations
for popular cryptographic primitives and to verify them for memory safety,
functional correctness, and secret independence.

More details about the HACL* library and its design can be found in our ACM CCS 2017 research paper:    
https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/536

All our code is written and verified in [F\*] and then compiled to C via
the [KreMLin tool](https://github.com/FStarLang/kremlin/). Details on the verification and compilation
toolchain and their formal guarantees can be found in the ICFP 2017 paper:

## HACL* for Paparazzi

HACL provides an automated export into C code from KreMlin. For use on bare-metal embedded system such as Paparazzi, we had to modify the autogenerated kremlin stubs to remove references to `printf()` and `exit()`, as well as implementations of endian swapping functions. The core of HACL* hasn't been modified and we are looking into adding support for bare-metal targets into HACL* repo.

To save space, we also removed the unused files so for the full list of available features please consult [HACL\*] repo.

The primitives and constructions supported currently are:

* Elliptic Curves: Curve25519
* Elliptic Curves Signatures: Ed25519
* Hash functions: SHA2 (256,384,512)
* TLS API: IETF Chacha20Poly1305 AEAD
